# Extreme Sensitivity Analysis (ESA) for Large Language Models

This repository contains tools and frameworks for conducting advanced sensitivity analysis on transformer-based language models, focusing on identifying and characterizing "super weights" - the most critical parameters within neural network architectures.

## üìã Research Overview

This framework supports Ph.D. research on Extreme Sensitivity Analysis (ESA) in Large Language Models, with the following key objectives:

- **Super Weight Identification**: Discover and prioritize the most critical weights in transformer architectures
- **Robustness Enhancement**: Improve model resilience against noise, perturbations, and adversarial attacks
- **Efficient Pruning**: Enable knowledge-guided compression by preserving critical parameters
- **Security Analysis**: Evaluate vulnerability to bit-flip attacks and memory corruption
- **Method Comparison**: Compare traditional gradient-based sensitivity with LLM-based attribution methods

The framework builds on Hugging Face Transformers and supports various architectures including Llama, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, OPT, BLOOM, Pythia, Falcon, and Mistral.

## üî¨ Research Methodology

This framework implements several approaches to sensitivity analysis:

1. **Layer Ablation**: Zero out weights and measure performance degradation
2. **Gradient-based Analysis**: Use gradients to estimate parameter importance
3. **Hessian-based Analysis**: Second-order derivatives for more accurate sensitivity
4. **Noise Injection**: Controlled noise addition to test robustness 
5. **Bit-level Manipulation**: Simulate hardware faults through bit flips
6. **LLM-based Attribution**: Novel approach using language models for weight attribution
7. **Integrated Gradients**: Attribution through gradient path integration

Each analysis method helps identify different aspects of weight sensitivity and contributes to a comprehensive understanding of model robustness.

2. **pruning**: Prune model weights to create smaller models
   - Removes less important weights based on sensitivity analysis
   - Creates pruned model files in the data directory

   - **Output Example**: `Pruned model (80% threshold): 23MB (43% smaller), 1.4x faster inference, perplexity increased by 15%`

3. **robustness**: Test model robustness under various conditions
   - Adds controlled noise to weights and measures performance impact
   - Evaluates model stability under perturbations
   - **Expected Output**: Graphs showing performance vs. noise level, critical noise thresholds where model breaks down, and layer-wise robustness rankings
   - **Output Example**: `Model maintains 90% performance up to noise level 0.05; attention layers most sensitive to perturbation`

4. **adversarial**: Run adversarial attacks against the model
   - Tests model response to carefully crafted inputs designed to mislead

    - Focuses on the most critical weights for targeted analysis
    - Creates impact visualization showing relationship between % weights perturbed and performance degradation
    - **Expected Output**: Performance degradation curves, comparison between targeted vs. random perturbation, and critical perturbation thresholds
    - **Output Example**: `Perturbing 0.01% of super weights causes same degradation as random perturbation of 5% weights; model breaks at 30% super weight noise`

### Expected Output Patterns by Analysis Type

#### Sensitivity Analysis
The output will show which layers and components are most critical to model performance. Look for:
- Perplexity increases when specific layers are ablated
- Heat maps highlighting sensitive components
- Lists of weights ranked by sensitivity score

```
Layer sensitivity ranking:
1. transformer.h.8 (124% perplexity increase)
2. transformer.h.4 (98% perplexity increase)
3. transformer.wte (word embeddings) (87% perplexity increase)
...
```

#### Super-Weights Analysis
You'll receive detailed information about the most critical weights in the model:
- Their locations within the model architecture
- Their relative importance scores
- Visualizations showing their distribution across layers
- The impact on performance when these weights are modified

Example output will include something like:
```
Super weight analysis complete. Found 217 super weights out of 125M parameters (0.00017%).
Distribution by layer type:
- Attention layers: 68%
- Feed-forward networks: 23%
- Embeddings: 9%

Top 5 super weights:
1. transformer.wte.weight[4242] - Sensitivity: 0.87
2. transformer.h.8.attn.c_attn.weight[512,768] - Sensitivity: 0.83
3. transformer.h.4.mlp.c_proj.weight[2048,768] - Sensitivity: 0.79
...
```

#### Robustness Testing
The output will show how the model performs under various perturbations:
- Performance degradation curves showing model quality vs noise level
- Critical thresholds where performance significantly drops
- Comparison of different noise types (Gaussian, uniform, targeted)
- Layer-wise robustness rankings

Example terminal output:
```
Robustness test complete.
- Model maintains >90% performance up to noise level œÉ=0.05
- Performance cliff at noise level œÉ=0.08 (drops to 42%)
- Most robust component: Feed-forward projection matrices
- Most sensitive component: Attention query matrices
```

#### Comparative Analysis
When comparing different sensitivity methods, expect:
- Similarity matrices showing agreement between methods
- Execution time comparisons
- Analysis of which methods identify which super weights
- Recommendations on which method to use for your specific needs

Generated output will include summaries like:
```
Method comparison results:
- Jaccard similarity scores:
  * Gradient vs Z-score: 0.76
  * Gradient vs Hessian: 0.65
  * Z-score vs Hessian: 0.59
  
- Execution times:
  * Gradient: 45.3s
  * Z-score: 12.7s
  * Hessian: 193.8s
  
- Super weight agreement:
  * All methods agree on 42% of weights
  * 18% uniquely identified by Hessian method
```

#### Pruning Analysis
After running pruning commands, expect:
- Model size comparisons before and after pruning
- Performance metrics on benchmark tasks
- Inference speed improvements
- Sample outputs comparing original and pruned models

For example:
```
Pruning complete:
- Original model size: 498MB
- Pruned model size: 214MB (57% reduction)
- Inference speedup: 2.3x
- Performance impact:
  * WikiText perplexity: +15%
  * GLUE score: -8%
  * Generation coherence: -11%
```

#### Selective Weight Pruning
As shown in the earlier example, you'll see significant differences in model behavior:
- The original model may show repetitive patterns or specific quirks
- The pruned model typically exhibits different generation style and content
- Performance metrics will quantify the changes
- Visualizations will show which components were most affected

In addition to text comparison examples, you'll also see metrics like:
```
Selective pruning of attention value components (80th percentile):
- Weights zeroed: 27,648 (20% of target components)
- Overall model size impact: 0.53% reduction
- Perplexity change: +17.3%
- Generation diversity: +43% (measured by unique n-grams)
- Topic coherence: -12%
```

#### Bit-Level Analysis
This analysis shows how bit-level changes affect model performance:
- Bit position sensitivity rankings
- Critical bits that cause model failure when flipped
- Quantization potential analysis
- Hardware fault simulation results

Example output:
```
Bit-level sensitivity analysis:
- Sign bit flips cause 87% average performance drop
- Most significant 8 bits are critical (>50% performance impact when modified)
- Bits 0-3 (least significant) can be truncated with <5% quality impact
- Quantization recommendation: 8-bit quantization safe for most layers
```
